# [Mandarin 8] (https://leungk712.github.io/Mandarin8/)

Mandarin 8, a Michelin-starred restaurant located in Las Vegas, NV

This project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One thing that I really wanted to work on in this project was 
practicing my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills. I've noticed in my past projects I've been too dependent on Bootstrap 4 and wanted
to challenge myself to make sure I know as much as possible about CSS by strengthening my skills. 

I wanted to keep this restaurant website simple. I did some research with top restaurants in the world and looked at their
websites, most of which kept it really simple and pleasing (in my opinion) to the viewers. 

I also included animations in this project, as well as setTimeout in JS to not only improve my JS skills, but to learn more about
asynchronous programming. 

Biggest challenge so far was trying to show an element once an anchor tag was pressed while hiding the other content. Definitely
struggled for a few days trying to figure out. Found a solution which I was OK with temporarily, but knew it was too repetitive,
thus I condensed it down into a function (removeShow()).
